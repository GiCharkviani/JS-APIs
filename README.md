# Our Library

## How we do
## `after break`
1. **Task**
2. **Code Review (30-1)** - add into *"What to do"*
 | <b><sup>if:</sup></b> having time - DO IT; in the end <small>(JS or/and TS)</small> still not sorted - DO IT!  
3. **Jonas (Writing Library)** <sub>checking in *"what to do"* and setting as the first priority</sub>

<sup>then:</sup> only what is new or neccessary to learn or remind 

<sup>then:</sup> <b>if time, learn all step by step</b> 

## *importantly:*
- working on separate branches
- in the end for both, merging on main branch

### *after:*
#### start Typescript course
