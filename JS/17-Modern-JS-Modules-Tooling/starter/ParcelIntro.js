/* PARCEL */
/*
we will use parcel boundle bilder
for that we need: npm i parcel --save-dev

Parcel is also CLI. if we don't install globally (-g), then we have to include or in package.json scripts property as an order, or to use order - npx

then we run - npx parcel index.js

after this order, parcel also will run local server where will be bundled js
also will create dist (distribution) folder, where will be boundles

also not needed to include extentions in imports or requires or other type of modules (even pictures)

when it boundles, uses only that function, that is imported and not all modules
